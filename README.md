# Mobile Device Keyboard
This is an implementation of the Mobile Device Keyboard along with a simple driver. It is assumed you have a java/maven 
development environment already set up. I used java 11 to develop this so I don't guarantee that previous versions will
work. I sure hope it works for you because it works on my machine.
## Build Instructions
This is a maven project, so from the root:

`mvn clean install`
## Run Instructions
Again, from the root of the project:

`java -cp mobile-device-keyboard/target/mobile-device-keyboard-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.kessler.mdk.Driver`

Then follow the instructions on the screen.
